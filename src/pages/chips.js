            question: "What is the process of snack making?",
            answer: "The process of snack making typically involves several steps: selecting ingredients, preparing them (chopping, slicing, etc.), combining ingredients according to a recipe or personal preference, cooking or assembling the snack, and finally, serving or packaging it. This process can vary greatly depending on the type of snack being made, whether it's something simple like a fruit salad or a more complex dish like nachos.",

            question: "What is the manufacturing process of chips?",
            answer: "The manufacturing process of chips involves several key steps. First, potatoes are cleaned and peeled. Then, they are sliced into thin, uniform slices. These slices are washed to remove excess starch. Next, they are fried at high temperatures until they become crispy. After frying, the chips are seasoned with flavors such as salt, barbecue, or sour cream and onion. Finally, the chips are packaged and sealed for distribution. Quality control measures ensure consistency and taste.",

        {
            question: "What is the raw material for chips?",
            answer: "The primary raw material for making chips is potatoes. Potatoes are cleaned, peeled, and then sliced into thin, uniform slices to be fried. Other ingredients such as oil for frying and seasoning for flavoring are also used in the manufacturing process. However, potatoes are the main raw material that forms the base of most chip varieties.",
        },
        {
            question: "What are the main types of chips?",
            answer: "The main types of chips include potato chips, corn chips, tortilla chips, vegetable chips (like beetroot or kale), and grain-based chips. Each type offers unique flavors and textures.",
